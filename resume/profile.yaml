summary:    Choose to move my career path more towards the software side. I am passionate about learning new stuff as well as
applying new skills. Over the last 9 months, i have been working for Cibc in ITA project, which is spark/scala based ETL project with Azure.
 By the end of the period, I am starting to build up a wide knowledge base and learning how to
quickly adapt to new concepts, which I believe makes me invulnerable in the Data Engineering industry. For leisure time,
I like to play competitive video games with friends which can make me feel energize and improve my ability of instance
reaction. Overall, I am excited to pursue a career as a software developer and further develop my skill sets.

      "– Designed a Java8 based application called JavaGrep that searches all files in a directory recursively for a
        user-provided regular expression. Implemented method that contain those expressions and sent into a new file.
      – Developed a JDBC-based application that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL
        database using DAO pattern.
      – Designed a Java8 based application called TwitterCLI which helps users create, read, and delete posts on Twitter
        using Twitter Rest API. Implemented four versions of the TwitterCLI application - basic Java version, Spring
        Beans version, Spring Component Scan version, and Springboot version. Wrote Unit Tests and Integration
