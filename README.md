# Shawn(Xinyu) Wang . Jarvis Consulting
I recently graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. 
After I graduated, I chose to move towards the software side mostly.
I am passionate about learning new technologies as well as applying new skills.
Over the last year, I have done several projects related to computer programming.
Throughout my education and my varied project experiences, I am starting to build up a wide knowledge base and learning how to quickly adapt to new concepts, which I believe makes me more confident in software engineering.
During my leisure, I like to play competitive video games with friends which make me feel energized and improve my ability of instant reaction.
Overall, I am excited to pursue a career as a software developer and further develop my skill sets.

## Technical Acumen

**Proficient:** Java, Linux/Bash, RDBMS/SQL, Agile/Scrum, Git, C, Raspberry PI

**Competent:** Python, Springboot, Mockito, Java Lambda & Stream APIs, Junit, C++. MATLAB, Embedded System

**Familiar:** Google Cloud Platform, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Machine Learning

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_shawn](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_shawn)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**:   
  * Developed a cluster monitoring bash agent that records hardware specifications and monitors
resource usage (per minute) of all nodes in a cluster. Provisioned PostgreSQL database in nodes to store
information of all nodes with the help of the bash agent installed in all of them. Utilized cron job to schedule the
collection of resource usage information every minute. Coded SQL queries to generate reports for some business questions.
                                      
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**:  
  * Designed a Java application that searches all files in a directory
recursively for a user-provided regular expression and machined lines are saved to an output file. Implemented the application using Java 8 Stream and Lambda APIs in order to improve application efficiency. Ultimate maven to manage the project dependencies.
  * Developed a JDBC-based application that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database
using DAO pattern. 
  * Designed a Java8 based application called TwitterCLI which helps users create, read, and
delete posts on Twitter using Twitter Rest API. Implemented the application using Springboot. Wrote unit and
integration tests for the applications using JUnit4 and Mockito libraries. 
                                     
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**:   
  * Implemented a Java 8 and Springboot based REST API of a trading platform that uses IEX Cloud (a REST API that provides stock data)
as a data source and PostgreSQL to persist data. Used a three-tier microservice architecture to implement it. Made
use of Spring DAO to handle data access in PostgreSQL. Wrote unit and integration test using JUnit4 and Mockito.
Dockerized the application.  
                                      
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: 
  * Provisioned the stock tracking simulation Springboot application using AWS services, such as EC2, ALB, Autoscaling, docker, etc. The application is scalable, fault-tolerant, and elastic. Built a CI/CD pipeline with AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Jenkins.

- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: 
  * Wrote a Zeppelin notebook using Hive SQL. Optimized Hive SQL's efficiency using partition and columnar file format. Compared time difference when doing the same query on tables with different optimization.

- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  *[Not started]*

## Professional Experiences

**Associate Data Engineer, Jarvis, Toronto (2020-Present):**

Utilized machine learning framework and TensorFlow to create computer vision and neural networks using a camera.

## Education

**Carleton University (2014-2019)**, Bachelor of Engineering, Electrical Engineering

## Highlighted Personal Projects

- **Raspberry Pi auto water refill system with GCP utilization and ESP8266 chip:**  
Created an auto water refill system through a Wi-Fi network for cats. Created an object detection system by using the Google Cloud Vision. 
Applied Arduino and C++ knowledge and utilizing the MQTT data transfer protocol to send a signal to control the 5v water valve for water refilling.
Applied raspberry pi and python knowledge and TCP/IP protocol to send data to google cloud vision to detect empty food and water and send an email back to host account with picture for the status check.
Achieved a home automation system by using knowledge of the IoT system. Customers can send back an email with signals, the pet will never worry about water and food supply.

- **Raspberry Pi RFID Attendance System Construction:**   
Utilized Raspberry Pi and the RC522 RFID chip to build an attendance system with an LCD screen and database.
